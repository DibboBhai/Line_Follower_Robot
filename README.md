# Problem Statment

There is a track which has a black line and rest of the area is white in the track. There will be a starting point and stopping point and many lines will be there which connects the start and stop point. The bot is supposed to follow the black line and there will be many challenge like unexpected turns and different ways in which the bot will be misguided from the end line. The bot has to avoid the challenges and reach the stop point as fast as possible.
