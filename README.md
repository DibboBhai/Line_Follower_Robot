# Problem Statment

There is a track which has a black line and rest of the area is white in the track. There will be a starting point and stopping point and many lines will be there which connects the start and stop point. The bot is supposed to follow the black line and there will be many challenge like unexpected turns and different ways in which the bot will be misguided from the end line. The bot has to avoid the challenges and reach the stop point as fast as possible.

# Concept/Theory

The IR sesor isa device which is capable of emitting infrared lights to sense some aspect of the surroundings and can be employed to detect the motion of an object.  This light propagates through the air and hits an object, after that the light gets reflected in the photodiode sensor. The above concept is used to detech the change in the black line and then process accordingly. Expermentally we saw that whenever a sesor detect black line then it gives output as 1 and whenever it detects white region then it gives output 0. 

By using the above concpet we will use to maneuver
